This includes my education, experience and campus involvement. It also has links to my email, LinkedIn and Github url’s.  The  Relevant Projects  tab is where you can find projects that I have completed, on my own, throughout my courses. It showcases a portion of my skills, however, my skills are not limited to those only shown on this tab.  The reason for me creating this site is rather simple. I wanted a way to showcase my abilities outside of a resume and to offer a more interactive method to get to know me. Consider this website as my virtual handshake to you, from me.\nWith that being said, I urge you to explore the website to your liking and if you have any questions, or want to contact me via email or LinkedIn, please feel free to reach out!\n\n\n\n",
