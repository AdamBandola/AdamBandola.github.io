title: "Retention Predictive Modeling"
description: |
  In this post we are looking at assigning a likelihood of a student not being retained by a university, based on only the application data of the student. In this case, the definition of retention is a student who starts as a typical freshman in college and returns for their first semester of sophomore year.
